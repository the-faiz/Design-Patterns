Facilitate the traversal of different data structures
Iteration (traversal) is the core functionality of various data structures
An iterator is a class that facilitates the trasversal > Keeps a reference to the current element, and knows how to move to a different element
Can be used implicitly > Range-based for and coroutines
Iterator > Object that facilitates the traversal of a data structure

An object can be iterated (traversed) if it defines a begin()/end() pair
An iterator sepcified how you can traverse an object
Typically requires of != and ++ operators
++ is called sporadically, so cannot be recursive.
Coroutines allow recursion througth generator yielding functions
