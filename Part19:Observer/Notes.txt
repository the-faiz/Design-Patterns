We need to be informed when certain things happen
>Object's field changes
>Object does something
>Some external event occurs

We want to listen to events and notified when they occurs
Terminology:
>even and subscriber
>signal and slot(boost, Qt,etc)
slot mean the function that handles a signal

An observer is an object that wishes to be informed about events happening in the system. The entity generating the events is an observable.

Two components: obsever and observable
observable provides a way of subscribing to an event (signal)
Observer preforms the subscription
Observable implementation is always intrusive (observer does not need to be)
Multithreading/reentrant use can cause issues
Ready-made implementation of Observers are available in boost library
