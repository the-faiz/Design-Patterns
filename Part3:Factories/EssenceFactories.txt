1.Object creation logic becomes too convoluted
2.Constructor is not descriptive
>Name mandated by name of containing type
>Cannot overload with same sets of args with different names
>Can turn into optional parameter hell
3.Object creation (non piecewise, unlike Builder) can be outsources to
>A separate function (Factory Method)
>That may exist in a separate class (Factory)
>Can create heirarchy of factories with Abstract Factory

===> A component responsible solely for the wholesale (not picewise) creation of objects is called a Factory


A factory method is a static method that creates objects
A factory can take care of object creation
A fctory can be external or reside inside the objext as an inner class
Hierarchies of factories can be used to create realted objects
