Adapter: A construct which adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y

Implementing an Adapter is easy
Determine the API you have and API you need
Create a componenet which aggregates (has reference to,...) the adaptee
Intermedaite representations can pile up; use caching and other optimizations
