Command Design Patters: An onject which represents an instruction to perform a particular action. Contains all the information necessary for the action to be taken.


Command vs Query:
A comand = asking for an action or change (does not have a return value)
A Query = asking for information (has a return value)
CQS : Command Query Separation : having separate means of sending commands and queries


Encapsulate all details of an operation in a separate object
Define instruction for applying the command(either in the command itself, or eleswhere)
Optionally define instruction for undoing the command
Can create composite commands (aka macros)
