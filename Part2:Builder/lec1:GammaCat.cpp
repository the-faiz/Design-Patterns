Gamma Categorization:
DP is split into three categories:

1. Creational Patterns:
>Deals with the creation of objects(construction)
>Explicit (constructor) vs implicit (DI, reflection)
Wholesale(single statement) vs picewise(step-by-step)

2.Strutural Patterns
Concerned with the strucrure (eg. class memebers)
many patters are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface
Stress the inportance of goog API design

3.Behavioral Patterns
Theyr are all different; no central theme
