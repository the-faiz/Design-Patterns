1.Complicated objects are not desisned from scratch. They are reiterate existing designs
2.An existing design is a Prototype
3.We make a copy or clone of the prototype and customize it -> We need to make a deep copy
4.We make the cloning effiecient using Factory

=>A Prototype is a partially or fully initialized object that you copy(clone) and make use of

Prototype design pattern is just about deep copying
We can create deep copies using copy constructors

=>to implement a prototype, partailly construct an object and store it somewhere
=>Clone the prototype
1. Implement your own deep copy functionality
2. Serialize and deserailize
=>Customize the resulting instance
